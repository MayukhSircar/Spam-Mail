Spam Mail Classifier Project:

Introduction:
This project aims to build a spam mail classifier using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The classifier will identify whether an email is spam or not. The dataset used in this project is the Spam CSV dataset from Kaggle.

Dataset
The dataset can be found on Kaggle at Spam CSV.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
Libraries:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
keras
tensorflow

STEPS TO BUILD THE CLASSIFER:
1. Data Collection
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place the CSV file in the data/ directory.
2. Data Preprocessing
Load the dataset using pandas.
Clean the data by removing any unnecessary columns.
Tokenize, lowercase, and remove punctuation and stop words from the email text.
Convert the text data into numerical data using TF-IDF vectorization.
3. Splitting the Data
Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.
4. Building the ANN Model
Create a Sequential model using Keras.
Add layers to the model: input layer, hidden layers with ReLU activation, and an output layer with sigmoid activation.
Compile the model with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.
5. Training the Model
Train the model on the training data.
Validate the model using a validation split.
6. Evaluating the Model
Evaluate the model on the test data to check its accuracy.
Fine-tune the model if necessary by adjusting hyperparameters.
7. Deployment
Save the trained model.
Use the model to predict whether new emails are spam or not.
